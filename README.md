# Macroeconomic-Response-to-COVID-19

This repository contains two datasets:
* **Nigeria.csv:** includes the tweet id, sentiment class, and sentiment score of the geotagged tweets gathered for Nigeria using the Twitter developer's academic researcher API and keywords employed, unemployed, and lost * job(s), where * is a wildcard (i.e. lost his job, lost her job, lost my job, lost their jobs).
* **SouthAfrica.csv:** includes the tweet id, sentiment class, and sentiment score of the geotagged tweets gathered for South Africa using the Twitter developer's academic researcher API and keywords employed, unemployed, and different forms of retrenching (i.e. retrench, retrenched, retrenches, retrenching, retrenchment, retrenchments).

In order to have access to the actual tweet or any other metadata, the tweet ids need to be hydrated.
